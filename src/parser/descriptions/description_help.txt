1. Introduction

In order for the program to determine what descriptions to use when solving an equation. The program picks the most relevant description to use after solving certain equations.

Example:
We are given the equation: 5x=50
So in this equation we will try to find out what x is.
The program will find out what x is by displaying each step it does in order to find out what x is.
After this, the program will attempt to prove that it found out what x is, correctly.

The program will display the following information:
----
5x=50
Find substitution for x by dividing 5 on both sides

(5x)/5=50/5
Solve using BEDMAS

x=10
Replace x with 10 in first entry

5*10=50
Solve Using BEDMAS

50=50
Compare 50 with 50

TRUE
5*x is the same as 50 by replacing x with 10
---

Each of the steps above shows the equation that we are attempting to solve with highlighted values(not shown in the text file) with what will be solved next. 
Then underneath the equation will contain the description of what we are doing to the highlighted values.
