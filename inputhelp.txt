The Input Field is primarily for each individual description. Each description has different inputs.
Some descriptions do not require inputs, where as some others have have 5 different inputs.
Each input is a representation of something that has been solved in an equation.
			
Example 1:
2+4*5
Solve using BEDMAS
			
The above Equation (2+4*5) needs to be solved using BEDMAS. So '*' needs to be solved before +.
The Description for this equation (Solve using BEDMAS) does not require any inputs to be displayed. So anything put in the Inputs Field will never be used.
			
Example 2:
x=8
Replace x with 8 in the first equation.
			
The above is an example of an Equation that requires inputs in order to be displayed. In this case it requires two inputs.
The Inputs given are 'x' and '8'. Where as the rest of the description will always be the same regardless of the inputs.
			
Example 3:
11/
Replace <1/> with <2/> in the first equation.
/11
You can tell what descriptions require inputs by opening a .tag file and looking for a tag similar to '<1/>'; but the 1 can be replaced with any number, starting at 1 and increasing.
			
In the TagParser. There is an InputField where you can test what the description will look like.
You can enter a single input into this field by typing it in.
To enter more than one input, you will need to seperate the inputs using a colon ( : ).
			
Example 4:
Description:  'Compare <1/> with <2/> to see if they are the same.'
Input Field:  '3x:25'
Final Output: 'Compare 3x with 25 to see if they are the same.'
			
			
Example 5:
Input Field:  '2xy:100:x,y:25,2'
Final Output: '2xy is the same as 100 by replacing x with 25 and y with 2.'
			
Some descriptions can have sub-inputs such as Description 6. (Example 5)
This description has 4 inputs. (2xy),(100),(x,y) and (25,2). But for this section we will focus on the last two.
x and y are considered to be sub-inputs for the main 3rd input and are seperated via a comma ( , ).
